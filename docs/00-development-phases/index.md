# Development Phases Index

**Version:** 1.5 **Date:** 2025-11-13

This project will be built in small, manageable phases to ensure stability and focus. Each phase builds upon the previous one, gradually transforming a local single-player prototype into a polished massively multiplayer game.

## Phase Overview

### [Phase 1: Core Local Game (Client-Only)](./phase-1-core-local-game.md)
Create a single-player, local-only version with basic physics, jump mechanics, and collision detection.

### [Phase 2: Basic Server & Client Connection](./phase-2-server-connection.md)
Connect a single client to the Go server with WebSocket communication and server-controlled gameplay.

### [Phase 3: Client-Side Prediction & Multiplayer Ghosts](./phase-3-prediction-ghosts.md)
Re-enable client-side responsiveness and add "ghost" players with interpolated movement.

### [Phase 4: Deterministic Procedural Generation](./phase-4-procedural-generation.md)
Create the "infinite" level using seeded PRNG, generated by the server and sent to clients.

### [Phase 5: The Full Game Loop](./phase-5-full-game-loop.md)
Implement the complete player experience: main menu, death/respawn cycle, and leaderboard system.

### [Phase 6: Polish & Tooling](./phase-6-polish-tooling.md)
Add final aesthetics (parallax, shaders, animations), audio, and developer tools (debug HUD, load testing, admin panel).

## Phase Progression Strategy

**Current Phase:** Phase 1

**Completion Criteria:** Each phase should be fully functional and tested before moving to the next. Don't skip ahead—stability is more important than features.

**Testing Approach:**
- Phase 1: Manual testing in browser
- Phase 2: Single client connection test
- Phase 3: 2-5 concurrent clients test
- Phase 4: Verify deterministic generation across multiple clients
- Phase 5: Full user flow testing (join → play → die → respawn)
- Phase 6: Load test with 500+ simulated clients

**Rollback Plan:** Each phase's code should be committable as a working state. Use git branches or tags to mark phase completions.
